<h2>Welcome to Kitty!</h2>
<p></p><p></p>
This is the web page where we will introduce you into how to run the bot, as well as some other garbage. Also I promise to make this look better.
<p></p><p></p>
Kitty is meant to be a sort-of "operational baseline" for Discord bots, off which you can base your bot by adding more modules.
<p></p><p></p>
<h2>Features I want to put in</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="upcoming/stocks.html">Stocks</a></li>
  <li>Global Chat</li>
  <li>Server Analytics</li>
  <li>Compatibility with Python</li>
  <li>!link - with two options: Automated Setup (!invite auto) and Customized Setup (!invite custom)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Automated Setup - This link will include the admin permissions you will give to the bot, no additional roles.</li>
    <li>Custom Setup - This link will not include any permissions, you can only invite the bot and then give them a specific role set up for members like them.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p></p><p></p>
